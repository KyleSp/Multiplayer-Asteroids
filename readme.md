# Multiplayer Asteroids

In 1979 Atari released an arcade space shooting game called Asteroids. Essentially you control a spaceship and fly around the screen shooting asteroids, increasing your total score. At certain times, an alien spaceship appears and shoots at you, and killing it yields a higher score. It had a two-player component, but it would involve two people taking turns in front of the same device, the winner being the one with the highest score by the time each player ran out of lives.

Multiplayer Asteroids is very similar to Atari's Asteroids, however the two players play concurrently on separate devices, being able to interact with each other's spaceship.
